Do I feel motivated after some failure? That's not my natural reaction. My instinct is to hide, be alone, and self-indulge to feel better. I'm not saying that my natural response is “good” or “bad,” but on the spectrum of *helpful vs. unhelpful* or *skilled vs. unskilled*, I'd call it unhelpful and unskilled.

This week, I made two coding mistakes that reached production and caused issues. They created extra work for others—and I felt defeated, miserable, and sorry. It was the kind of week you just want to end. Yes, I felt embarrassed and discouraged. I even started to question whether I'm still up to the task—and the negative self-talk piled on. It was time to take a moment and _decide_ how to respond.



Sulking and listening to sad music sounds good. Distracting myself with Netflix or comforting myself with food and drink? All very tempting. But if I follow my natural instinct (an unskilled response), I miss out on an opportunity. I can choose instead to use these feelings to motivate personal growth (a more skilled response).

I can start asking:
- Could I have prevented this situation? How?
- What new insight do I have that will help me prevent a similar result next time?
- What new skill gaps am I now aware of? What's my plan for closing them?

Even if our initial reaction isn't useful, we can *make* it useful. That's the difference between reacting unskillfully and responding with skill. Feeling good about a result reinforces behavior and encourages us to do more of it. Feeling bad about a result can motivate us to avoid the actions that led to it—and to work toward creating better outcomes.

Don't let one negative result cascade into more. Take a moment—walk in nature, or do whatever helps you refocus—and begin learning from the experience.

It's difficult to work through embarrassment, pain, and unintended consequences. But it takes a learned, skilled response to turn those feelings into motivation—and to find a way to perform better at your next opportunity.
