If you are in the Krakow area, checkout out [Zakrzówek Park](https://zzm.krakow.pl/lista-parkow/446-zakrzowek.html) located just south of Karkow's Main Square.

An amazing, nicely modernized area to relax, hike, and swim. When it is a little too cold for water, there are great trails for hiking and biking.
