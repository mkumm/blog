_Merkur Mk34c Double Edge Razor_


## My Shave

About a year ago, I started seeing ads on social media for a sleek-looking single-blade razor—but the price seemed a bit steep. After some digging, I found this little gem on Amazon for about a third of the price. The [Merkur Mk34c Razor](https://amzn.to/3HZhc7N). I've been using it ever since, and I love it.

I really enjoy the feeling of shaving with a single blade again. It reminds you why they used to call shaving a “scrape”—but in the best way. For blades, I use [Astra blades](https://amzn.to/3HZhc7N), which cost about 8 cents each.
