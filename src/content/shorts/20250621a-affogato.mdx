We got hooked on affogatos after we tried one at [By The Way Restaurant](https://bytheway.bar/). Several months later we came across [Figle](https://www.facebook.com/p/Figle-100075998304608/) which quickly became our favorite gelato place. They have a Basque cheesecake ice cream that is in my top 3 ice creams anywhere. They also have an amazing affogato that is large enough for us to share -- but best to gest your own.
