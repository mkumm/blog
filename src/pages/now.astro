<h2>Working at DraftKings</h2>
<p>
	I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.draftkings.com/">DraftKings</a
	>, where I get to write <b>Elixir</b> for one of the largest online sportsbooks
	and casinos—two things I'm passionate about (Elixir and Gaming). I'm fortunate
	to work with some of the brightest and most supportive people in the Elixir community.
</p>

<h2>Poland</h2>
<p>
	I've been mostly in Kraków, Poland for nearly four years, and I really love
	it. Our apartment is modest, but the location is fantastic—we're just a few
	hundred yards from a beer garden, my gym, a farmer's market, two regular
	grocery stores, and a tram stop. The city center is just 20 minutes away,
	and cheap round-trip flights put most of Europe within easy reach.
</p>
<p>I still maintain my home in Michigan and travel back often.</p>

<h2>Nauka języka polskiego (Learning Polish)</h2>
<p>
	I'm finally learning to speak Polish. Progress is slow, but I'm really
	enjoying it. If you're also interested in learning Polish, I highly
	recommend
	<a href="https://e-polish.eu/polish-for-foreigners">Glossa</a> and they work
	with students worldwide. A special thank you to <PersonLink
		img_src="/profiles/magda.png"
		name="Magdalena Wyglądacz"
		link="https://e-polish.eu/en/polish_teachers_online/magdalena_wygladacz"
	/>, my ever patient (and professional) teacher!
</p>

<h2>Solo Projects</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>Sprytna Cards</dt>
	<dd>	I was inspired by people building useful little products, so I decided to
	try it myself. In about three months (and under $100), I launched <a
		href="https://sprytna.cards/">Sprytna.Cards</a
	>
	to beta. It is now out of beta but there are still some key features to add before
	I start promoting it.</dd>

	<dt>Greenway App</dt>
<dd>
	Still in private/secure mode, it was built for people (or groups) to track
	property expenses, especially for rentals.
</dd>

<dt>AnyOneWillDo</dt>
<dd>Just a random picker - not a dating app - I repeat - NOT A DATING APP! :)</dd>

<dt>Sprytna League</dt>
<dd>
	A fun take on choosing the points your team will score each week. If your
	team scores at least as many points as you predeict, you get the points you
	guessed (not more). If your team doesn't score as many points as you
	guessed, you get 0 points for the week. You can see a sample page <a
		href="https://sprytnaleague.com">sprytnaleague.com</a
	> while I build out the platform.
